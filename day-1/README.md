## <html>
The `<html>` tag represents the root of an HTML document.

The `<html>` tag is the container fro all other HTML elements (except for the `<!DOCTYPE>` tag) 

`Note: ` You should always include the `lang` attrubute inside the `<html>` tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.
